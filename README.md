# Simple joke app
A simple one page wesbite built using Lit Elements, that sends requests to Jokes API (https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) and displays the result. 

Allows the retrieval of non-safe jokes also (no responsibility is taken for the jokes retreived using this setting).

## To run locally

Install dependancies

```bash

cd lit-element-starter-js

npm i

```

To run development server 

```bash

npm run serve

```

To view the page navigate to http://localhost:8000/dev.
